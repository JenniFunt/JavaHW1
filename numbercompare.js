//Create a conditional statement that compares two numbers.
//You can choose if those numbers will be equal ==, less than <, greater than >,
//less than or equal to <=, or greater than or equal to >= each other.
//Include an if, else if, and else statement. Create an alert() that gives feedback based on the number. 
//Test your statement with different numbers to make sure all alerts work.
